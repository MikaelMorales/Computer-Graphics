# Computer Graphics

An OpenGL application which generates a terrain geometry and renders the 3D scene on the GPU. A camera, pictorially illustrated in the global view, follows a configurable BÃ©zier path through the scene.

**_Featured techniques:._**<br>

* Procedural terrain generated by ridged multi-fractal with Perlin noise function.
* Material texturing based on terrain height and gradient.
* Seamless cube-mapped skybox.
* Water reflection, refraction and depth effects.
* Distortion of reflections on the water
* Free flying and FPS exploration modes.
